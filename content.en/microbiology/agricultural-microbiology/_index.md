and Nitrogen are microbe mediated and play a very significant role in replenishing the nutrient supply in soil. Certain microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and viruses are economically important since they cause plant diseases and are responsible for severe crop losses. The study that deals with plant diseases is called plant pathology.

There are microorganisms capable of producing plant hormones thereby enhancing the plant growth. Some micro organisms can be used as biopesticides as they have ability to kill insects that damage plants.

## Biogeochemical Cycles


Biogeochemical cycling is defined as the movement and conversions of materials by biochemical activities throughout air, water and soil. All living organisms participate in biogeochemical cycling but

The _Anabaena azollae-Azolla_ association is a symbiotic ationship between a blue green alga and a rice plant. _Azolla_ is mall, fast growing floating water fern. In the cavities leaves of azolla, _Anabaena azollae_ a blue green algae cyanobacterium) fixes nitrogen from the air.




  

microorganisms play a major role. This is because of their high enzymatic activity and their ubiquity.

Most macro elemental components of living organisms like Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Oxygen, Phosphorus and Hydrogen are cycled most intensely and other elements like Copper, Chromium, Iron, Zinc, Nickel are cycled less intensely.

### Carbon Cycle


Carbon is a macro element present in all living cells. In microorganisms, they are present in all macromolecules like cell wall, cytoplasmic membrane, proteins and nucleic acids.

**Reservoirs of Carbon:** Reservoirs are the storage places of nutrients that are present in nature. They store nutrients in large amounts for longer periods of time.

Atmospheric CO2, dissolved carbon in oceans and freshwater, organic matter are actively cycled carbon reservoirs. Sediments and fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas are slowly cycled carbon reservoirs. Carbon is cycled between these reservoirs by the biochemical activities of micro organisms and other living things (Figure 11.1).

The different stages or processes involved in carbon cycle are

1\. Photosynthesis 2. Decomposition 3. Methanogenesis

**1\. Photosynthesis** It is a process where atmospheric CO2 is converted to organic carbon (CH2O)n. This is carried out by higher plants, photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria and algae using radiant energy from

the sun. This can be explained by the equation,

CO2 + H2O  (CH2O)n + O2

where (CH2O)n represents the organic form of carbon (Example: Carbohydrates) which gets incorporated into the photosynthetic organisms. This organic carbon serves as food for herbivores and in turn for carnivores.

**2\. Decomposition** The organic matter fixed as a result of photosynthesis is eventually degraded by microorganisms to CO2 during processes like respiration and decomposition. When aerobic and anaerobic organisms respire, CO2 is released into the atmosphere. Much of the CO2 is released when dead organisms decompose in the soil predominantly by the activities of soil microorganisms. Burning of fossil fuels also release CO2

into the atmosphere.

**3\. Methanogenesis** It is an anaerobic process where CO2 gets converted to CH4 (methane) by strict anaerobes like methanogens (Example: _Methanobacterium_). Methanogens are a group of Archaebacteria found in anaerobic environments like swamps, marshes, rumen of ruminants, paddy fields and gut of termites.

H2 + HCO3 - + H+  CH4 + 3H2O

Methane is converted back to carbondioxide by a process called **Methylotrophy**.

### Nitrogen Cycle


The element Nitrogen (N) is a key constituent in microbial cell. Nitrogen  

is needed for the formation of proteins, amino acids, nucleotides and is present in a number of oxidation states inside the cell. Nitrogen is cycled between atmosphere, organic compounds in living things, soil and sediments.

The processes that are involved in Nitrogen cycle are

1\. Nitrogen fixation 2. Nitrification 3. Ammonification 4. Denitrification

**Nitrogen fixation** Nitrogen is present as N2 (N N) in air (78% N2). The triple bonded state of nitrogen makes it very stable and nitrogen in its gaseous state cannot be assimilated by plants or animals for their metabolism. Only few groups of prokaryotes are

**Fistulated cow:** Fistulated cows are very useful in studying rumen microorganisms and ruminant nutrition and are used to treat indigestion in cows. Fistula is a sampling port that allows access to the rumen. Rumen is the first and the largest chamber of the stomach of cows and other ruminant animals.

capable of breaking the triple bond and use it for building up their proteins and aminoacids. The process of reduction of gaseous nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH4) is called Nitrogen fixation. This process is carried out by a group of prokaryotes called diazotrophs.

N2+8H  2 NH3 + H2

_Cyanobacteria_, _Rhizobium_ and _Frankia_ are some of the examples of **diazotrophs** that can fix atmospheric nitrogen. The fixed ammonia gets incorporated into proteins and amino acids, thus building up organic nitrogen.

**Ammonification** The production of ammonia during the decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds, by micro organisms after the death of plants and animals is called **ammonification** (Figure 11.2). Much of the ammonia released by aerobic decomposition in soil is taken up rapidly by plants and micro organisms and is converted to amino acids.

Bacteria like _Bacillus, Clostridium, Pseudomonas_ and fungi like _Aspergillus, Mucor_ and _Penicillium_ are few examples of micro organisms that can ammonify.

**Nitrification** The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrate (NO3) is called **nitrification**. It is carried

out by nitrifying bacteria. It is a two step process where ammonia is first converted to nitrite (NO2) and then to nitrate (NO3).

2NH3 + 3O2  2HNO2 + 2H2O

The above given oxidation reaction is the first step that produces nitrite. This reaction provides energy and is carried out by _Nitrosomonas_ and _Nitrosococcus_.

In the second step, the nitrite is oxidized to nitrate

2HNO2 + O2  HNO3

This reaction is carried out by _Nitrobacter_.

Nitrates are readily assimilated by plants but are very water soluble and rapidly leached from soil.

**Denitrification** The reduction of NO3

\- from soils by denitrifying bacteria to gaseous nitrogen is called **denitrification**. In this process, carried out by bacteria like _Pseudomonas, Thiobacillus denitrificans,_ organic compounds serve as hydrogen donors and nitrates serve as electron acceptor.

NO3  NO2  N2O  N2

**Biological Nitrogen Fixation** One of the most significant biological process taking places on the Earth is biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). This fixation of atmospheric nitrogen carried out by few prokaryotes is cost efficient because industrial production of ammonia by Haber’s Bosch process is very expensive.

Organisms carry out BNF in a free living state in soil or they can establish  

symbiotic association with other plants or micro organisms and fix N2. Organisms capable of BNF are

**Free living** Aerobic _Azotobacter_

**BNF by _Rhizobium_ in leguminous plants** Leguminous plants belong to the family Leguminaceae and bear seeds in pods. Example: Black gram, Green peas, Soyabean, Subabul. The bacteria belonging to the genus _Rhizobium_ which can exist in free living state in soil but can enter into symbiosis with legume plants and carry out nitrogen fixation.

**Process of BNF** It consists of the following steps

1\. Infection of legume roots by _Rhizobium_ 2\. Formation of root nodules 3. Reduction of N N to NH4 in root

nodules

**1\. Infection of legume roots by _Rhizobium_** _Rhizobium_ recognises and attaches to the root hairs of legume plant. It invades the root hairs and secretion of certain _nod_ factors result in root hair curling typically called **Shepherd’s crook symptom** which leads to the formation of infection thread. Infection thread is a cellulosic tube like structure through which _Rhizobium_ moves into the cortex from root hairs.

**2\. Formation of root nodules** The invaded plant cells are stimulated to divide repeatedly thus forming a mass

of tissue on the roots which are called root nodules (Figure 11.3). Root nodules are fleshy light pink colored globose structures seen on the roots. The bacteria inside the root nodules transform into swollen, mishappened forms. These are called **bacteroids**. The bacteroids are capable of nitrogen fixation (Figure 11.4)

**3\. Reduction of N N to ammonia in root nodules** This biochemical process is catalysed by an enzyme called **Nitrogenase** present in bacteroids and happens under diminished O2 levels. The O2 levels in the nodules are controlled by an oxygen binding protein called **leghemoglobin**. This is a red, iron containing protein which can keep the nodule environment free of oxygen.

**Nitrogenase** The enzyme nitrogenase is a complex enzyme consisting of 2 enzymes, dinitrogenase reductase and dinitrogenase. Electrons from organic compounds like pyruvate are passed on to dinitrogenase reductase first and then to dinitrogenase which in turn passes them to N N thus reducing it to NH4. This reduction needs 16 ATP, ferredoxin and cytochromes.

### Phosphorus Cycle


The element phosphorus (P) is an essential macro element in all living organisms. They are found in nucleic acids and phosphate esters. It is an essential component of ATP and other high energy phosphates and phospholipids.

**Reservoirs of Phosphorus** 1\. Phosphate rock like apatite, a large

inert reservoir 2. Marine and aquatic sediments 3. Dissolved phosphates in soils and

waters 4. Organic phosphates in dead and living

organisms.

Phosphorous transformations mostly happen as inter conversion of inorganic to organic phosphate and insoluble form to soluble phosphates.




  

**Phosphate solubilizations** Most of phosphates occur in combination with Calcium, Iron, Magnesium and Aluminium (inorganic P) and thus are insoluble and unavailable to plants and micro organisms. Some micro organisms solubilize those insoluble phosphates by producing organic acids. Example: _Thiobacillus, Bacillus_ thus enabling the plants to utilize it.

**Phosphate assimilation** Plants and micro organisms can readily assimilate soluble forms of inorganic phosphates like H2PO4

\-, HPO4 -2 and HPO4

\-3

and incorporate them as organic forms of phosphates like ATP, nucleic acids.

The ability of bacteria to solubilise phosphates can be tested in the laboratory by streaking the bacterial culture in Pikovaskaya agar which contains tricalcium phosphate. Positive cultures show clear halo around growth.

**Phosphate mineralisation** Breakdown of organic phosphates to form soluble inorganic phosphates is called mineralisation. Organisms produce phosphatase enzymes and catalyse mineralisation. The mineralised phosphates can be utilized by plants (Figure 11.5).

### Sulphur Cycle


Sulphur is present in sulphur containing aminoacids. The sulphur cycle involves oxidation – reduction reaction between Sulphate (SO4), Elemental S and H2S and hence there is change in the valence states of sulphur from -2 to +6.

The basic steps involved in sulphur cycle are

1\. Sulphide/ sulphur oxidation

2\. Sulphate reduction

**2-)** It is carried out by prokaryotes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, H2S is spontaneously oxidized at neutral pH to elemental sulphur. Elemental sulphur is oxidized to suphates by chemolithotrophic bacteria like _Thiobacillus, Beggiatoa._

If light is available, H2S can be used as electron donor to carry out photosynthesis

**Sulphate reduction** When sulphate is present in habitats, different groups of microorganisms are capable of carrying out sulphate reduction.

Beijerinck described the use of sulphate (SO4

2-) as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration to form sulphide (H2S). This process is called **Dissimilatory** **Sulphate Reduction(DSR)**. The anerobic bacteria capable of carrying out DSR are _Desulfovibrio, Desulfococcus, Desulfotomaculum_ (Figure 11.6) This reaction by sulphate reducers requires organic carbon sources like pyruvate or lactate. H2S accumulated in such habitats by the action of sulphate reducers is toxic to aerobic organisms.

**Sulphur reduction** (S0H2S):

The dissimilative sulphur reducing bacteria can reduce elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Example: _Desulfuromonas_, an obligate anaerobe. Under aerobic conditions, organisms like _Pseudomonas, Proteus_ and _Salmonella_ are also capable of performing this reaction.

**Organic sulphur compounds reduction/oxidation** Organic sulphur compounds like dimethyl sulphide can be used as carbon and energy source for many microorganisms.

**Desulfurylation** It is a process where organic sulphur compounds are used up by microorganisms for energy to produce H2S.

## Biofertilizers


In India, the availability and affordability of fossil fuel based chemical fertilizers at the farm level have been ensured only through imports and subsidies. Indiscriminate and imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, especially urea, along with chemical pesticides and unavailability of organic manures has led to considerable reduction in soil health. Biofertilizers can act as a renewable supplement to chemical fertilizers and organic manures. They have the capacity to produce natural resistance in plants against pests and soil borne diseases, adding fertility to soil.

Nitrogen fixation by leguminous and other crops is reported to be 44 million metric tons per annum. The appropriate strain of _Rhizobium_ can increase the crop yield up to 10-35%. Also, residual N is beneficial for the next crops grown in the same field.

It has been estimated that 40-250 kg N / hectare(ha) / year is fixed by different legume crops by the microbial activities of _Rhizobium_.

**Definition** Biofertilizers are preparations containing beneficial micro organisms like N2 fixers, PO4 solubilizers in a viable static state intended for seed or soil application and designed to improve soil fertility.

**Advantages** 1\. They reduce the need for chemical

fertilizers. 2. They provide the plant with certain

vitamins, plant growth promoting substances and increase the vigour of the plant.

3\. It is cheap and cost effective.  

Based on the nutrients that they provide, biofertilizers are of the following types

**Nitrogenous biofertilizers-** • _Rhizobium,_ • _Azotobacter,_ • _Azospirillum_ • _Frankia_

**Phosphate solubilisers** • _Bacillus_ • VAM

### Rhizobium


_Rhizobium_ – legume symbiosis is a well studied plant microbe interaction and _Rhizobium_ is the most extensively used nitrogenous biofertilizer in India.

_Rhizobium_ is a gram negative, non-spore forming aerobic bacillus inhabiting the soil in a free living state. The colonies of _Rhizobium_ on YEMA (Yeast Extract Mannitol Agar) plate are gummy, pale white in colour (Figure 11.7). They can establish symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen thereby greatly improving soil fertility.

**Mass production of _Rhizobium_** The flowchart explaining the mass production of _Rhizobium_ biofertilizer is given below

Efficient N2 fixing strain of _Rhizobium_ are selected and initially grown in YEM

broth for 24 hours.

**Method of application of _Rhizobium_ to plants** Carrier based _Rhizobium_ inoculants are mixed with water to form slurry to which the seeds of plants are added (Figure 11.8). The coated seeds are dried in shade and used for sowing.

### Phosphate Solubilizers


Several soil bacteria like _Pseudomonas_ and _Bacillus_ possess the ability to convert insoluble mineral phosphates into soluble form by secreting organic acids thereby making it available to plants.

For mass cultivation and inoculant preparation, the cultures are grown in Pikovaskaya broth for 7-18 days and mixed in suitable carrier like peat or lignite. After curing for a week, the inoculants are packed and made ready for use in a similar manner as _Rhizobium_ inoculants.

## 3 VAM


Mycorrhiza means fungus root. It describes the symbiotic association between plant and fungus. Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM) is an endomycorrhiza which is used as a fungal biofertilizer. They mobilize the soluble

phosphates in the root zone of plants and satisfy the phosphorus nutrition of plants.

**Morphology** VAM is an example of endomycorrhiza meaning, the storage organelles of phosphates like vesicles and arbuscles are seen intracellularly. Vesicle is a globose structure and arbuscle is a tree like branching structure present in the root cortical cells (Figure 11.9). VAM fungi are naturally most prevalent in angiosperms. gymnosperms, pteridophytes and bryophytes.

**Figure 11.9:** The fresh water fern _Azolla._

**Mass production** Root based inoculum is used for preparing VAM biofertilizer (Figure 11.10). The selected spores of VAM fungi are allowed to infect plants like onion, sorghum and other grasses. After 3-4 months, the roots along with the soil are macerated or pelleted with an inert material and packed in polythene pouches which can be used as biofertilizer.

### Cyanobacteria / Blue green Algae


Blue green algae are single celled or filamentous prokaryote capable of nitrogen  

fixation and photosynthesis. Most of the filamentous forms have specialized large, thick walled cells called heterocysts which are sites of nitrogen fixation.

Example: _Nostoc_, _Anabaena_ is examples for filamentous BGA. _Gleocapsa_ is an example of unicellular BGA. Some of the filamentous forms do not possess heterocysts but still fix atmospheric nitrogen. Since they need standing water for their growth, BGA can effectively colonize paddy fields and enrich the soil with nitrogen.

**Mass cultivation of BGA** Applying BGA to paddy fields can reduce the amount of chemical nitrogenous fertilizer applied for the growth of paddy crop. Therefore cultivation of BGA in large quantities is necessary. Mass cultivation of BGA has the following steps.

1\. Isolation of BGA 2. Mass cultivation of BGA

**Isolation of BGA** BGA can be isolated from soil or paddy fields. Appropriate dilutions from serially diluted algal sample are inoculated in the liquid flasks containing algal media

**Figure 11.10:** Microscopic view of _Anabaena azollae_




  

like BG-11 or Pringsheim’s media. After several weeks of incubation at 28°C, the individual colonies are picked up, identified and stored. This can be used as starter culture for mass cultivation. Mass culture can be done in 2 ways.

**Mass cultivation of BGA 1. Open air shallow culture:**

Pits are prepared (6΄ × 3΄ × 9΄)

Filled with soil and 200g of superphosphate and water is added

Starter culture is sprinkled over water

1 week

Algal scum is formed on the surface

Water is allowed to dry and the dried up algal flakes are collected and stored

in poly bags

The dried algal flakes around 10kg/ha can be applied in paddy fields after transplantation.

### Azolla


_Azolla_ is a floating freshwater fern. The plant has a branched stem, deeply bilobed leaves which are arranged alternately on the stem and each leaf has a dorsal and ventral lobe (Figure 11.9). The dorsal lobe houses the cyanobacterial symbiont  

_Anabaena azollae_ (Figure 11.10). The fern and the cyanobacteria exhibit symbiotic relationship in which _Anabaena_ provides the fern with fixed nitrogen and fern provides niche for the cyanobacteria free from competition from other microorganisms.

_Azolla_ can be used as a nitrogenous biofertilizer for paddy crop. When applied into the paddy fields, _Azolla_ provides nitrogen nutrition to standing rice crop and can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.

**Mycorrhiza and orchid germination** In the early stages of their life cycle, all terrestrial orchids are non photosynthetic, totally lacking chlorophyll and relying on carbon(C) acquired from a fungal symbiont (Mycorrhiza) for growth until the production of the first green leaves above the ground, a nutritional strategy termed mycoheterotrophy. Around 200 species of orchids remain achlorophyllous throughout their lifetimes. Species such as _Galeola_, _Gastrodia_, _Corallorhiza_, _Rhizanthella_ and many others continue to gain carbon from mycorrhizal fungi.

**Infobits**




  

**Mass multiplication of _Azolla_**

Small plots (50-100 sq.m) or concrete tanks with standing water are

inoculated with _Azolla_

pH is adjusted to 8.0 with lime.

Superphosphate is applied as a nutrient and carbofuran is applied to deter insects

After 20 days, _Azolla_ biomass can be harvested and used as biofertilizer for

rice plantings

**Method of application of _Azolla_ in rice fields** _Azolla_ is grown on the flooded rice fields prior to planting for 2-3weeks. Then water is drained and _Azolla_ is incorporated into the soil followed by rice transplantation within a week’s time.

Why bio- fertilizer are preferred to chemical fertilizer?

## Biopesticides


Pests are insects that damage crop plants and stored products. They feed on leaves and roots or suck the sap of the plants causing severe crop losses. Chemical pesticides sprayed on plants can be  

detrimental to ecosystem if the usage is prolonged and pests may develop resistance to the pesticides.

The term **biopesticides** refers to compounds that are used to manage agricultural pests by means of specific biological effects. It refers to products containing biocontrol agents like natural substances such as plants, certain minerals, animals, micro organisms including their genes or metabolites.

They are an important part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy in controlling the pest.

**Advantages** They are less toxic to humans and environment and they do not leave harmful residues.

They affect only the target pest. They cause long term suppression of

pest populations since they persist in the environment.

Microbial biopesticides are of three kinds

1\. Bacterial biopesticide 2. Fungal biopesticide 3. Viral biopesticide

### Bacterial Biopesticide


Bacteria like _Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus papillae_ and _Bacillus lentimorbus_ have the potential to kill certain insect pests and are entomopathogenic.

**_Bacillus thuringiensis_** It is a gram positive, spore forming, rod shaped soil bacterium. During sporulation, the bacterium produces insecticidal proteins as parasporal crystals. These are called **_delta endotoxin_** also called as **_Cry proteins_**. **_Cry proteins_** are specifically




  

toxic to insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and other few insect orders.

**Mode of action of Bt** The Bt cells sprayed on the leaves have to be ingested by the larval forms of the insects in order to exert its action. This is because the Bt toxin gets activated in the insect gut at a specific pH.

**Process**

Insect ingests the parasporal crystals containing Cry protein

The crystals dissolve in the alkaline environment of the insect gut

The solubilised inactive delta endotoxin are cleaved rendering them active

The activated toxin binds to specific receptor of the midgut epithelium

This leads to the insertion of toxin thereby developing pores in the epithelium

Cell lysis and disruption of epithelium releases the cell contents leading to insect death.

**Symptoms** • Larvae stops feeding • Larvae becomes sluggish and static • Water oozes out from the body • Larvae dies and falls off the leaf  

Various species of Bt are able to work against cotton boll worm, cabbage worm and gypsy moths.

Photograph of a cotton plant showing opened and unopened bolls. BT cotton is a genetically modified cotton plant (GM crop) which has the gene for the crystal toxin integrated in its genome. Crystal toxin is expressed in plant parts which reduce the need for spraying pesticides. BT cotton is the only GM crop approved for commercial cultivation in India.

**Infobits**

### Fungal Biopesticides


These entomopathogenic fungi attack insects and cause diseases in insect body which lead to insect death. Two prominent fungi used as mycopesticide are • _Beauveria bassiana_ which causes white

muscardine disease • _Metarhizium anisopliae_ which causes

green muscardine disease

**Mode of action of _Beauveria bassiana_** _Beauveria bassiana,_ a filamentous fungus belongs to class Deuteromycetes also called imperfect fungi. It can be successfully used against Colarado potato beetle, (Figure 11.11) Codling moth and American boll worm.

This fungus invades the haemocoel of insects through spores. Once the spores attach to the cuticle, it germinates and the hyphae penetrates the insect cuticle (cuticle is the outer membrane of insects) Penetration is aided by formation of appresorium and penetration peg. The fungi




  

secrete chitinases, lipases and proteases which can dissolve the cuticle. The hyphae enter the haemolymph and proliferate and colonise the entire insect and release blastospores. Insect death occurs due to nutrient depletion of the haemolymph or by toxaemia by secretion of toxic metabolites.

**Figure 11.11:** Picture of insect infected with _Beauveria bassiana_

**Biopesticides registered in India:** 1_. Bacillus thuringien-_

_sis var. israelensis 2. Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki 3. Bacillus thuringiensis var. galleriae 4. Bacillus sphaericus 5. Trichoderma viridae 6. Trichoderma harzianum 7. Pseudomonas fluorescens_

### Viral Biopesticides


Viral insecticides are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods. Viral pesticides are used to control Lepidopteran larvae like _Helicoverpa, Spodoptera_ sp on Cotton, Corn, Sorghum, tomatoes. Baculoviruses are the commonly used viral biopesticide. They are extremely small and are composed of double stranded DNA. The genus Baculoviruses contains 3 subgroups.  

• Nuclear Polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs) • Granulosis viruses (GVs) • Non occluded viruses

**Mode of action of NPV** The virus enters the insect body via ingestion by insects and infects the midgut cells by membrane fusion. The NPV uncoat within the nucleus of cells and pass through the intestinal epithelium (Figure 11.12) and establish a systemic infection of the haemocoel.

**Symptoms** Discoloration (larvae turns brown or yellow) • Decomposition or softening of larvae • Lethargy • Infected larvae hang upside down twigs • Larvae become swollen with fluid

containing virus and eventually die turning black in color.

**Mass production of NPV** NPV are mass produced in laboratory using suitable larval hosts. The fifth stage larvae are fed with food infected with NPV. After 4-5 days, the dead larvae are collected and macerated. The liquid is centrifuged and the pellet containing the viruses is suspended in sterile distilled water. This viral suspension can be used for spraying in the fields.

**1Summary** Carbondioxide fixation and Biological Nitrogen Fixation are the most significant biological processes taking place on planet Earth. Methanogenesis is an anaerobic




  

process converting CO2 to CH 4. It is carried out by methanogens like _Methanobacterium_ sp. Phosphorous transformations mostly happen as inter conversion of inorganic to organic phosphate and insoluble form to soluble phosphates.Purple and green sulphur bacteria store sulphur as granules as a result of which they appear yellow in colour.

Biofertilizers are preparations containing beneficial micro organisms like N2 fixers, PO4 solubilizers in a viable static state intended for seed or soil application and designed to improve soil fertility.  

_Azolla_ and _Anabaena_ share symbiotic relationship in which _Anabaena_ provides fixed atmospheric nitrogen to _Azolla_.

Vesicles and arbuscles in VAM fungi are the storage organelles of polyphosphates.Blue Green algae are prokaryotes that can perform both photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation.

Biopesticides refer to compounds that are used to manage agricultural pests by means of specific biological effects. _Bacillus thuringiensis_ produces crystal toxin which is detrimental to insects.
