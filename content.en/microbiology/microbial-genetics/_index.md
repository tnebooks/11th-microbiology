Microbial genetics provides powerful tools for ciphering the regulation, as well as the functional and thway organization of cellular processes. The genetic dy of microbes has played a highly significant role in developments of Molecular Biology, Recombinant A Technology and in the preparation of useful ducts. Microbial Genetics makes microbes beautiful,

neficial and bountiful.

## Genetic Information is Stored in DNA


Microorganisms are diverse in nature. A particular bacterium can be identified based on certain characteristics. When a bacterial cell grows and divides, it gives rise to cells with similar characteristics. Have you ever pondered as to why some of the characteristics of progeny cells are similar and a few dissimilar?

In the middle of the 19th century it was assumed that there was some particle present somewhere in the cell which

was the controlling factor to carry the characteristics from one generation to another.

Genetics, a branch of science aims to understand the working of the controlling factor. The factor governing the transfer of information is now very well known as Gene. Gene can be defined as a unit of heredity which is transferred from parent to progeny.

Although there were experiments to prove the inheritance pattern due to gene, there was no real understanding of the molecular nature of the gene. Work of Frederick Griffith introduced the transforming principle which was further confirmed as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by experiments of Avery, Mac Leod and Mac Carty in 1944 followed by Hershey and Chase in 1952.

### Frederick Griffith’s Experiment


In 1928, British b a c t e r i o l o g i s t Frederick Griffith (Figure 14.1) was trying to develop a vaccine against pneumonia. In his experiments Griffith used two related strains of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (Figure 14.2)_._

**Figure 14.1:** Frederick Griffith

**Figure 14.2:** Rough and Smooth co  

1\. Rough strain (R) – avirulent, non-capsulated strain, forming rough colonies on culture media.

2\. Smooth strain (S) – virulent, capsulated strain (resists phagocytosis), forming smooth colonies on culture media.

Griffith injected live smooth strain into mice which caused disease and killed it. When he injected live rough strain into mice, it did not cause disease and mice remained alive. He heat killed the smooth strain and injected into mice, the mice remained alive. But the experiment gave surprising results when a mixture of harmless live rough strain and heat- killed smooth strain was injected into mice. Griffith observed that the mice developed pneumonia and died. Further, when he analysed the blood sample from dead mouse, he found that it contained live smooth strain. This accidental discovery made Griffith to conclude that the rough strain changed (transformed) into smooth strain by taking up a substance which he called a “transforming principle” from heat killed smooth bacteria. This phenomenon is called “Bacterial Transformation” Griffith’s experiment is summarized in Figure 14.3.

(Figure 14.4) used the extracts of heat-killed smooth bacteria and treated it with enzyme protease, RNase, DNase to eliminate proteins, RNA and DNA respectively. Each of the treated extracts were mixed with live rough bacteria and injected into mice. The mice injected with a mixture of DNase treated extract and live rough strain did not die. This partially proved that DNA was responsible for changing the rough strain of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ bacteria into smooth bacteria. Avery _et al.,_ experiment is summarized in Figure 14.5. Later Hershey and Chase’s experiment on T2 bacteriophage confirmed that genetic information is present in DNA.

These important early experiments and many other lines of evidence have shown that DNA bears the genetic information of living cells and it is responsible for transfer of characteristics from one generation to another. This is true in all organisms, the notable exceptions being RNA viruses

## DNA Structure


• DNA is a polymer of simple monomeric units, the nucleotides (Figure 14.6).

• Each nucleotide is made up of three components: 1. Nitrogenous base 2. Sugar 3. Phosphate group

• Nucleotide without phosphate group is known as nucleoside.

### Watson And Crick Model of DNA Double Helix


In the early 1950’s, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used the powerful method of X-ray diffraction to shed more light on the structure of DNA. From the X-ray Diffraction pattern it was deduced that DNA molecules are helical. In 1953 Watson and Crick (Figure 14.8) postulated a three dimensional model of DNA structure based on Franklin’s X-ray crystallographic studies. In recognition of their work leading to

• The pairing of two strands creates a major groove and minor groove on the surface of the duplex.

• The two strands are antiparallel, that is their 5ʹ, 3ʹ phosphodiester bonds run in opposite directions.

• The vertically stacked bases are 3.4 Aº apart.

• Each complete turn of double helix con- tain base pairs, which is 34 Aº units long.

### Erwin Chargaff ’s Rule


In the late 1940s Erwin Chargaff and his colleagues found that the four nucleotide bases of DNA occur in different ratios in the DNA of different organisms. Erwin

Chargaff measured the quantity of the bases in DNA and noticed that the number of Adenine is equal to the number of Thymine and the number of Guanine is equal to the number of Cytosine residues. Hence the sum of Purine residues equal to the sum of the Pyrimidine residues.

### Alternative Forms of DNA


DNA is a remarkably flexible molecule. Considerable rotation is possible around a number of bonds in sugar-phosphate backbone and thermal fluctuations can produce bending, stretching and unpairing of the strands. Watson and Crick model of DNA is called as B-DNA or B-form. However DNA can exist in A or Z form. In 1979 Alexander Rich discovered Z form (Figure 14.10). Recently, several alternative forms of DNA have been discovered C-form, D-form and E-form. The B-form of DNA is the most stable structure and is therefore the standard point of reference in any study of the properties of DNA (Table 14.1).

## DNA Replication


DNA is a marvelous device for the stable storage of genetic information. DNA replication is a process in which copies of DNA molecules are faithfully made. Here double stranded DNA molecule is copied to produce two identical dsDNA molecules. Replication is an essential process because whenever a cell divides, the two new daughter cells must contain the same genetic information in DNA as parent cell. DNA replication occurs during the S (DNA synthesis) phase and precedes cell division.

Watson and Crick proposed the hypothesis of semiconservative replication. According to them each DNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new strand, producing two new DNA molecules each with one old strand and one new strand. (Figure 14.11).

### Meselson and Stahl’s Experiment


Mathew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1957 gave experimental evidence for semiconservative replica- tion process.

**Steps** 1\. _E.coli_ cells were grown for many

generations in a medium containing radioactive isotope (heavy isotope) of nitrogen source 15N.

2\. After many generations all nitrogen containing molecules in _E.coli_ cells, including nitrogen bases of DNA contained 15N.

3\. The cells labeled with 15N were then transferred to a medium containing only 14N (light isotope). Hence all subsequent DNA synthesised during replication contained 14N.

4\. Cell samples were removed at periodic time intervals from the growth medium.

5\. From each of the above samples, DNA was isolated and subjected to density

• 14N containing DNA will reach equilibrium at a gradient point closer to the surface of the tube.

**Observed Results** • After first generation the isolated DNA

occupied an intermediate density band. • After second generation two bands

were observed, one at intermediate density and the other at lighter density corresponding to the 14N position in the gradient.

These experimental results and other experiments repeated by Meselson and Stahl with prokaryotes suggested that semiconservative mechanism of replication is universal (Figure 14.12).

### Enzymes Involved in DNA Replication


DNA replication in _E.coli_ requires many enzymes and proteins, each performing a specific task. The entire complex is called the DNA replicase system or replisome. The major enzymes and proteins involved with their functions are tabulated in Table 14.2.

• First in vitro synthesis of DNA with a template was carried out by Kornberg in 1959.

• First in vitro synthesis of DNA without template was carried out by H.G. Khorana in 1965.

### Events in DNA Replication in _E.coli_


1\. Initiation 2. Elongation 3. Termination

DNA replication is depicted in Figure 14.14.  

**Initiation** • DNA replication is initiated at

replication origin known as oriC (245 base pairs in _E.coli_).

• Dna A protein molecules bind to the origin of replication.

• Helicase (DnaB ) denatures the DNA helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds between base pairs.

• Many molecules of SSB (single stranded binding) proteins bind cooperatively to single stranded DNA, stabilizing the separated strands and preventing renaturation.

• Gyrase (topoisomerase) releases the topological stress produced by helicase.

• RNA primers are synthesised by primase.

The separated polynucleotide strands are used as templates for synthesis of complementary strands. The area of the DNA opened by helicase for DNA synthesis is referred to as the replication fork. At the replication fork there are four strands of DNA, two are conserved and two are newly synthesised. Replication may occur in either a unidirectional or bidirectional manner (Figure 14.13) from each origin. Bidirectional replication can be explained as two replication forks moving in opposite directions around the circular chromosome. Both forks move along the double helix away from the origin of replication in opposite directions and around the circular chromosome.

**Elongation** • DNA synthesis proceeds in a 5ʹ3ʹ

direction( read as 5 prime to 3 prime). • One strand is synthesised continuously

and is known as leading strand.

chain from a free 3ʹOH end, but none can initiate synthesis.

• Synthesis of DNA requires nucleoside triphosphates or nucleotides - deoxyadenosinetriphosphate (dATP), deoxythymidinetriphosphate (dTTP), deoxycytidinetriphosphate (dCTP), deoxyguanosinetriphosphate (dGTP). When a nucleoside triphosphate bonds to sugar in a growing DNA strand, it loses two phosphates.

• RNA primer synthesised during initiation is removed and replaced with DNA by DNA polymerase I

• Sealing of the nick by DNA ligase which catalyses the formation of phosphodiester bond between a 3ʹ hydroxyl end of one DNA fragment and 5ʹ phosphate at the end of another strand. The elongation phase of replication

includes two distinct but related operations • Leading Strand Synthesis • Lagging Strand Synthesis

**Leading strand synthesis** begins with the synthesis of short (10 to 60 nucleotide long) RNA primer at the replication origin. Deoxyribonucleotides are added to this primer by DNA polymerase III. Leading strand synthesis then proceeds continuosly, keeping pace with the unwinding of DNA at the replication fork. The continuous strand or leading strand is one in which 5ʹ3ʹ synthesis proceeds in the same direction as replication fork movement.

**Lagging strand** or discontinuous strand is one in which 5ʹ3ʹ DNA synthesis proceeds in the direction opposite to the direction of fork movement. This strand is synthesised as short fragments, known as  

Okazaki fragments named after R. Okazaki. Okazaki fragments range in length from a few hundred to a few thousand nucleotides depending on the cell types. Each okazaki fragment must be initiated by the action of primase. Once an Okazaki fragment has been completed its RNA primer is removed and replaced with DNA by DNA polymerase I and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase.

The fidelity of DNA replication is maintained by (1) base selection by the polymerase, (2) a 3ʹ5ʹ proofreading exonuclease activity that is part of most DNA polymerases, and (3) specific repair systems for mismatches left behind after replication.

RNA dependent DNA polymerases, also called reverse transcriptases, were first discovered in retroviruses, which convert their RNA genomes into double-stranded DNA as part of their life cycle. These enzymes transcribe the viral RNA into DNA, a process that can be used experimentally to form complementary DNA.

**Infobits**

**Termination** Eventually, the two replication forks of the circular _E.coli_ chromosome meet at a terminus region called Ter (for terminus). The Ter sequence function as binding sites for protein Tus (Termination utilization substance). The Tus-Ter complex can arrest a replication fork from only one direction. When either replication fork encounters a functional Tus-Ter complex, it halts. The other fork halts when it meets the first (arrested) fork (Figure 14.15).




  

### Eukaryotic DNA Replication


Replication in Eukaryotic cells is more complex. The DNA molecules in Eukaryotes are considerably larger than those in bacteria and are organized into complex nucleoprotein structures (chromatin). The essential features of DNA replication are same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, some interesting variations do occur. Initiation of replication in all eukaryotes requires a multisubunit protein. Multiple origins of replication are probably a universal feature in eukaryotic cells. Like bacteria,

eukaryotes have several types of DNA polymerases (Example: DNA polymerase α \[alpha\] and DNA polymerase δ \[delta\]). Some have been linked to particular functions, such as the replication of mitochondrial DNA. The termination of replication on linear eukaryotic chromosomes involves the synthesis of special structures called telomeres at the ends of chromosome.

What will happen if single stranded binding proteins are not present during replication of DNA?

**Summary**

Many lines of evidence show that DNA bears genetic information. Frederick Griffith showed transformation of bacteria. Avery, Mac Leod, Mc Carty experiment and further experiment by Hershey Chase confirmed that DNA is the transforming principle.

There are two types of nucleic acid: RNA and DNA. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides, joined together by phosphodiester linkages between the 5ʹhydroxyl group of one pentose and the 3ʹhydroxyl group of the next. The nucleotides in RNA contain ribose, and the common pyrimidine bases are uracil and cytosine. In DNA, the nucleotides contain deoxyribose sugar, and the common pyrimidine bases are thymine and cytosine. The primary purines are adenine and guanine in both RNA and DNA.  

Erwin Chargaff rules states that A = T and G = C. Watson and Crick postulated that DNA consists of two antiparallel chains in a right-handed double-helical arrangement. Complementary base pairs, A = T and G C, are formed by hydrogen bonding within the helix. The basepairs are stacked perpendicular to the long axis of the double helix. DNA can exist in several structural forms. Two variations of the Watson-Crick form, or B-DNA, are A-DNA and Z-DNA.

Replication of DNA occurs with very high fidelity and at a designated time in the cell cycle. Replication is semiconservative, each strand acting as template for a new daughter strand. It is carried out in three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination.

The reaction starts at the origin and usually proceeds bidirectionally. DNA is synthesized in the 5ʹ3ʹ direction by DNA polymerases. At the replication fork, the leading strand is synthesized continu- ously in the same direction as replication fork movement; the lagging strand is syn- thesised discontinuously as Okazaki frag- ments, which are subsequently ligated by DNA ligases.

Most cells have several DNA polymerases. In _E. coli,_ DNA polymerase III is the primary replication enzyme. Replication of the _E. coli_ chromosome involves many enzymes and protein factors. Replication is similar in eukaryotic cells, but eukaryotic chromosomes have many replication origins.
